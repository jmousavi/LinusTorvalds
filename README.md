... LinusTorvalds
- Named after Linus Pauling, the famous physics chemist and Nobel prize winner 
- His maternal grandfather, Leo Toerngvist (professor of statistics) who bought his first personal computer, the commodore Vic 20
- He got bored with the few programs available for it so he started creating his own, first Hsiang the basic programming language then using a more powerful language such as assembly
- Torvalds wanted his new operating system to be called Linux (from Linus and MINIX), but he thought it was too conceited of him so he decided to call it Freax (a combination of free, freak and MINIX). However, his friend, Lemmke created a directory for it called linux, therefore becoming the name of the operatingn system.
